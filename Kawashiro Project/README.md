# The Kawashiro Project - A Multi-Purpose Discord Bot for /r/weather

## An Overview

After surviving the meme hell that is CPSC 121 and 210, I am returning to C# to make a bot for the server.
*Nitori* - The bot agent, will be filling in the gap brought on by MEE6. 

## Goals
The following list will be the main scope for Nitori:
- Clearing the 🎶djs channel once everyone leaves all voice channels
- A mutiple choice poll system where you can vote by emoting to the message
- Post some dank memes as the successor to *Anarkali* like !flexmoney
