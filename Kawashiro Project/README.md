# The Kawashiro Project - A Discord Bot for /r/weather

## An Overview
*Nitori* - The default namesake of the bot agent, will be filling in the gap brought on by MEE6.\
After surviving the meme hell that is CPSC 121 and 210, I am returning to C# to make a bot for the server.


## Goals and User Stories
The following list will be the main scope for Nitori:
- Clearing the 🎶djs channel once everyone leaves all voice channels
- A mutiple choice poll system where you can vote by emoting to the message
- Post some dank memes as the successor to *Anarkali* like !flexmoney
